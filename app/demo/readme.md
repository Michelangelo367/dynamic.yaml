## working samples directory

This directory contains sample dynamic YAML files for demonstration.

### Blockspring

Some of these work with [blockspring](https://open.blockspring.com/dreftymac/2dc5183fbb912fc3c553fc14bbe15e43).

Some functionality does not work with blockspring because blockspring is currently limited to upload of a single file.

Therefore, features that depend on access to the local filesystem, (such as `datafile` include directive) do not work.
