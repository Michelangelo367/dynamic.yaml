      ### ********************
      #   * in this example, the assignment to variable `ttname` was moved
      #   * it is in the first templateinclude file
      #   * now the variable is properly populated in the remaining templates
      #   * this is still a contrived example, the variables here are defined only in templates
    templateinclude:
      - {"section":"head", "path": "bare.hello.0000.init.txt"}
      - {"section":"head", "path": "bare.hello.0000.head.txt"}
      - {"section":"foot", "path": "bare.hello.0000.foot.txt"}
    offtemplateinclude: "bare.hello.0000.head.txt"
    template: |
      Hello {{ ttname }}!
